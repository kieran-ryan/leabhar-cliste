## Software Design

In terms of software design, there are two overarching approaches:

- **tactical** - focus to get something working, such as a feature or bug fix
  - nearly impossible to produce a good system design
  - initially deliver faster, but the time saved is quickly given back as development slows - technical debt builds up quickly
  - Adoptee: Facebook, with their motto "Move fast and break things"
- **strategic** - focus to produce a great design, which also happens to work
  - working code is not considered enough
  - initially deliver slower, but the cost of this investment becomes free as development accelerates
  - Adoptee: Google, with heavy emphasis on high quality code and good design
